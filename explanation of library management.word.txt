This program is an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-based web page that serves as a library management tool. It allows users to view and filter a list of books and navigate through the list using pagination. Here's an explanation of the different parts of the program:

1. HTML Structure:
   - The program starts with a standard HTML5 document declaration: `<!DOCTYPE html>`.
   - Inside the `<html>` tag, there are `<head>` and `<body>` sections.
   - In the `<head>` section, the title of the page is set to "?????????????? ????????????????????".
   - In the `<style>` tag, the CSS styles for various elements are defined.
   - The `<body>` section contains the main content of the web page.

2. CSS Styling:
   - CSS is used to style the appearance of the elements in the web page.
   - Styling includes font settings, margins, padding, border properties, background colors, and animation.
   - There are specific styles defined for the `<table>`, `<th>`, `<td>`, `<button>`, `<input>`, and `<img>` elements.

3. Book Data:
   - The program includes a JavaScript array called `books`, which contains data about various books.
   - Each book is represented as an object with properties such as `title`, `author`, `subject`, and `publishDate`.

4. Pagination and Table Display:
   - The program allows users to navigate through the list of books using pagination.
   - The number of books displayed per page is defined by the `pageSize` variable (currently set to 10).
   - The `currentPage` variable keeps track of the currently displayed page.
   - The total number of pages, `totalPages`, is calculated based on the number of books and the page size.
   - The `displayBooks` function is responsible for rendering the books in the table based on the current page.
   - The `filterBooks` function allows users to filter books based on title, author, subject, and publish date. Filtered results will be displayed on the first page.
   - The "Filter" button triggers the `filterBooks` function when clicked.
   - The "Previous" and "Next" buttons trigger the `prevPage` and `nextPage` functions, respectively, to navigate through pages.

5. Dynamic Table Generation:
   - The `displayBooks` function generates the table rows (`<tr>`) and cells (`<td>`) dynamically based on the data in the `books` array.
   - It updates the table with the relevant book information according to the current page and page size.

6. Animation:
   - The `@keyframes slideIn` CSS rule defines an animation called "slideIn", which gives a sliding animation effect to the table rows when they are inserted into the table.

7. Filtering Functionality:
   - The `filterBooks` function takes the input from the filter fields (`titleFilter`, `authorFilter`, `subjectFilter`, `publishDateFilter`) and filters the `books` array based on the user's input.
   - It then recalculates the total number of pages (`totalPages`) based on the filtered results.

8. Initial Display:
   - The `displayBooks` function is called initially to render the first page of books when the page loads.

Overall, the program provides an interactive interface for users to browse and filter a collection of books using HTML forms and JavaScript functions. The books are displayed in a tabular format, and pagination allows users to view different subsets of the book list.
